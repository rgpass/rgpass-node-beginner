# The Node Beginner

This is my site from following along with [The Node Beginner](http://www.nodebeginner.org/).

## What Was Covered

The tutorial covered establishing a server, routing, asyncronous request handling, creating forms, and uploading a photo. The uploading function does not work on Heroku as I did not connect my Amazon S3 account. When creating this app, I did not know how to securely store my acccount information and did not want to risk it.
